                        <h4>The story:</h4>
                        <p>Planted from seeds from Berton Seeds, I think sometimes in spring 2021.</p>
                        <p>By the end of December, they never been flowering yet, but they have been well and easy to maintain.</p>

                        <h4>About:</h4>
                        <p>Natice to Europe and around.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h4>Care:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Full sun</li>
                            <li>Well drained soil in drier side, can be achieved by mix the potting mix with a little bit of sand. Which is the case we have here. Maybe that's why it's been growing well.</li>
                            <li>Alkaline or especially chalky soil enhance the fragrance. pH under 6.5 can cause short life.</li>
                            <li>Regular watering while young, extremely drought-resistance once established.</li>
                            <li>Can stand large range of temperature, but don't like high humidity.</li>
                            <li>A handful of compost is a good idea when first starting, after that feeding is not needed and it can reduce the potency. Has been fertilized regularly using rose formula roughly every 2 week, either using indoor concentration or half outdoor concentration. Last fertilizing: 28 Dec, rose formula. Maybe then better no more.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Lavender 2:</h4>
                        <p>29 Dec: Series of new batches, from seeds, have been started since fall season started. However not much of the seeds grew into seedlings. Probably due to fungus gnat problem. After the last serious effort of fungus gnat elimination since mid of December, and combining what can be rescued from multiple pots, finally we have a long windowsil pot of lavender seedlings. It's currently covered in plastic wrap just in case it has fungus gnat investation.</p>
                        <p>30 Dec: Sacrificed because it looks like mold start going, since the pot has been kept very humid enclosed in cling wrap. lavender is very young still, 1-2 inches tall. Might as well start over.</p>
