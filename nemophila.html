                        <p>22 Dec 2021: Seeds (McKenzie) planted.</p>
                        <p>11 January 2022: 1 seedling has been sprouted for awhile by now, it's about 4 cm long. But that's it, no other seedling appears.</p>
                        <p>16 January: 4-5 fungus gnats fly out when the pot is tapped. Squashed. Didn't happen on previous days. Bowl cap put on immediately and observed more. Tapped a lot that day. Twice, 1 fungus gnat emerges. Squashed. Seed pouch stated the seedlings typically appears in 7-12 days. It's been about 3 weeks and only 1 appears. An indication that the rest of the seeds might have been eaten. Ready to be sacrificed. Will not plant more for now since don't have more seeds.</p>
                        <p>17 January: Tap in the morning, 2 come out. 1 squashed, will see again later. Will definitely be sacrificed, just want to observe the gnats.</p>
