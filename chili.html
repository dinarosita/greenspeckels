                        <h4>The journey:</h4>
                        <p>Planted from 1 chili pepper in spring or early summer 2021. Majority of the seeds grew into seedlings, there were so many. Unfortunately due to space limitation, only less than 10 is kept. Grow so fast during the peak of summer into a meter tall. Hand polinated. </p>
                        <p>(September?): First green chili was seen. They grow in size quite fast, but remain green for a long time. First observed red ripe chili was December.</p>
                        <p>22 December: Second home generation intitiated from seeds from 1-2 chili harvested.</p>
                        <p>Last week of December: pruning down the plants. Hopefully will be thriving. Actually the new growth have started before heavy pruning is started from tidying up since mid December. Because of that, I have the confidence to prune down quite heavily to a hald of the plants. the other half are trimmed mildly only so far.</p>
                        <p>29 Dec: First flower from new growth observed and hand polinated.</p>
