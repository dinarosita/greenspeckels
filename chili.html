                        <h4>First generation updates:</h4>
                        <p>Planted from seeds from 1 Thai bird eye chili from grocery store in spring or early summer 2021.</p>
                        <p>Majority of the seeds grew into seedlings, there were so many. Unfortunately due to space limitation, only less than 10 is kept. Grow so fast during the peak of summer into a meter tall. Hand polinated. </p>
                        <p>(September?): First green chili was seen. They grow in size quite fast, but remain green for a long time. First observed red ripe chili was December.</p>
                        <p>Last week of December: pruning down the plants. Hopefully will be thriving. Actually the new growth have started before heavy pruning is started from tidying up since mid December. Because of that, I have the confidence to prune down quite heavily to a half of the plants. the other half are trimmed mildly only so far.</p>
                        <p>29 Dec: First flower from new growth observed and hand polinated.</p>
                        <p>Mid Jan 2022: Soil covered in clay beads to prevent fungus gnats. It seems like it's not really working.</p>
                        <p>23 Jan: Fungus gnts seens flying aroudn from the pot. Yellow sticky trap was placed on the surface and pot covered in cling wrap. After 3 days, 51 fungus gnats were counted stuck to the trap. Another 2-3 flying away, 1 cought. Clay beads removed, top 1 inch soil removed, but nothing I can doo closer to the root which where they live if they are there. Pot covered in cling wrap again.</p>
                        <p>24 Jan: From the first harvest around Nov/Dec 2021, there were maybe 15-25 chili fruits that we enjoyed eating fresh, picking it from the tree as we need to eat it. The taste of the young ones, especially before it ripens, were mild and zesty. As it matures, it becomes spicier. The last few were frozen because they are start overripe before I can consume them. 1 of the overripen one was cut open and the seeds were planted. Since there are still 2 spots at the pot without seed, I use seeds from the next chili I ate (from the harvest too). Today, I'm eating the last chili from that harvest. It will be awhile until I can enjoy chili from the tree.</p>

                        <p>22 December: Second home generation intitiated from seeds from 1 first generation chili. There were 2 more empty spot.</p>
                        <p>Late December: Several seeds from another chili planted.</p>
                        <p>2 January 2022: All from first chili planted seems to be sprouting.</p>
                        <p>23 Jan: About 5-7 cm tall</p>
