                        <li>References mention Thai chili pepper doesn't need to be pinched when they are young. Also it's only about 30 cm tall. So I'm not sure why our plants are about a meter tall or maybe it's not even the same kind. So for the seedling, we are going to follow generic pepper pinching routine. Wait until there are 10 leaves (5 sets), pinch the top 2 sets.</li>

                        <li>For full harvest, wait until the plants reach full size and die out. About 2-4 months, up to 120 days. Potatoes can be left in  ground at this point for several weeks as long as the ground is not wet.</li>

                        <li>Low maintenance, no pruning required unless bonsai trees. For shaping, best to do it on fall. Remove dead limbs, trim back to shape, but don't cut into old wood. Limbs cut back too far will not generate new growth and will create a bare spot. Gentle pruning to remove unattractive brown dead foliage can be done with blasting water from a hose. Enough to remove dead foliage, without worry cuting to deep. For bonsai plant, pinching with hand regularly to shape is a good idea.</li>

                        <li>Sun - Even though direct sun can burn the leaves, it does need some light to encourage blooming. Maybe put the pot in east side facing window, especially if there's a sheer curtain in between. Then it does need 8 hours of darkness at least.</li>
                        <li>Water - African violets prefer to stay evenly moist. Ideally the soil feels like a well wrung-out sponge.</li>

                        <li>Repotting problem - doesn't like to be repotted to a large pot. Prefer to have it rather small. The pot should not be larger than 1/3 of plant's diameter.</li>
                        <li>6-8 hours of sunlight. Make sure removing shadow. Chase around the light.</li>
                        <li>Pruning each spring for more frequent and fuller bloom. Lavender sets buds on new growth, so stimulating the process can be a signal to the plant.</li>

            <h3>Fungus gnats</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Autumn 2021
                    <ul>
                        <li>We started seeing the appearance in our indoor plants around the summer 2021. By the time we were leaving for our summer camping trip, July-August, it got pretty bad. Dad treated it when we were away, but it's very hard to make it gone. Late summer to early winter, it's hard to grow seedlings from seeds. Pots after pots, almost none grow. When some do, only very little. Imagine a pot has 2x7 or 2x9 holes, each with several seeds. Usually many seedlings come out from each hole, this time could be just 1 or 2 seedlings from the whole pot. Back then we didn't know what's wrong.

                        </li>
                    </ul>                    
                </li>
                <li>Strategies started on late Nov / early Dec 2021:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Changing soil</li>
                        <li>Improving drainage by bottom layer pebbles</li>
                        <li>Covering soil top with pebbles or clay beads</li>
                        <li>Less watering</li>
                    </ul>                    
                </li>
                <li>Nov 2021
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attempt to remove fungus gnats population, especally with renewing soil, reducing the water, and adding sand layer to the surface, was always ongoing. However they just reduced in number and even with a small number of them, a flare up can happen fast.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Dec 2021
                    <ul>
                        <li>It's not until mid Dec the attempt feels to be taking a long  term effect. A new strategy here is covering the soil, especially the one with seeds and seedlings, with cling wrap or paper towel. New soil is used. And following that, even washed seedlings that was previously kept around, was discarded because worry larvae might be actually intact in the roots and can repopulate. With exception of basil and potato that's washed really thoroughly before and after kept in water medium overnight.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Jan 2022
                    <ul>
                        <li>Since then, gnats population decreased tremendously. Seeds grown in such condition, each holes thriving with abundance of seedlings. by January, almost no gnat seen.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Feb 2022
                    <ul>
                        <li>A few small outbreaks happen now and then but more or less controlled. Not everyday we see any gnats, and when it does usually just 1 or 2 close to the pot.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Strategy started Feb 2021:

                        <li>Deep watering</li>
                        <li>Vegetable safe insecticide spray<br>
                        We previously owned marigold based insecticide spray and used it late spring, however we haven't been able to locate the bottle, so we got a new one recently. That's why it's very delayed.</li>
                    </ul>

                <li>Feb 2022 week 1 - Chili
                    <ul>
                        <li>In large chili pot, under the fabric covering, there were about 5-8 gnats emerges from the ground. Aggresively dealt with vegetable safe insecticide spray, just around the soil.</li>
                    </ul>
