            <p>Don't let soil dry out.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Arugula
                    <ul>
                        <li>Regular watering. Water as soon as top inch feels dry. Keep soil consistently moist but not soggy. </li>
                        <li>Fail to do this might cause plant to bolt and flavor ruined.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Basil
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep soil regularly moist, 1" of water a week for outdoor, bit more for containers. Water once the top layer of soil dries out, definitely when plant show first sign of wilting (don't let it happen! don't wait for this signal!).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Cilantro
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep regularly moist but not soaked. Good drainage is important because cilantro has deep root. 1" per week.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Coleus
                    <ul>
                        <li>consistenly moist but not soggy.It should not wet all the time, but too long dry will slow plant growth. For indoor, water maybe every 2-3 days, or more if climate rather dry.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Chili
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep soil moist at all times, never allow soil to become bone dry as it will cause the blossom to drop. Especially during hot dry days. Containers might even need to be watered as frequent as twice a day if it dries out quickly.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep evenly moist but not soggy. 1-2" water/week. Never let the soil to dry out, parsley doeesn't tolerate drought well, will quickly wither and brown.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Polka dot plant
                    <ul>
                        <li>Moderate amount of moisture in soil at all time. Water when top hald inch dried out. Don't let soil completely dried out. It can lead foliage to wilt and struggling to survive. Don't get it soggy either, it can cause root rot and kill the plant.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Potato
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rely on steady water supply. Water at least 1 inch a week. Sensitive to drought especially when flowers (which is the peak time to form tubers).</li>

                        <li>Once established, moderately drought-tolerant. But make sure to water young plants, especially during dry period.</li>
                        <li>For young plants: Water twice a week. Once established: water once a week.</li>

                <li>Thyme
                    <ul>
                        <li>drought resistant, prefer under-watered than over-watered. Wait soil to be completely dry before watering. Flower is not a sign of bolting or over-watering. It will continue to thrive as long as keep trimming to promote new growth.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Not necessary but can make bloom more abundant. Low nitrogen, high phosporous. Miracle gro bloom formula is 15-30-15, probably best choice, followed by rose at 18-24-16. Slow releasing fertilizer is a good idea when planting. Otherwise, when leaves start forming, then every a half year. Or even just once a year, in early spring.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>If planted in nitrogen rich soil, doesn't need additional feeding. If it's lack of nourishment, the leaves turn pale.</li>

                </li>
                <li>Coleus
                    <ul>
                        <li>If soil is rich, no need to feed coleus at all. For poor soil, fertilize every month half strength. Color is better when not overly fertilized. Having said that... Container ones might benefit from slow-released fertilizer when starting the pot. Thereafter, feed with diluted liquid fertilizer every 1-2 weeks. Container plants generally need more frequent feeding than garden plants because frequent watering washes the nutrients away.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Thyme
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prefers soil that lacks nutrient. Only give diluted fertilizer when it needs a boost. Maybe in the beginning.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                        <li>For full harvest, wait until the plants reach full size and die out. About 2-4 months, up to 120 days. Potatoes can be left in  ground at this point for several weeks as long as the ground is not wet.</li>

                <li>Autumn 2021
                    <ul>
                        <li>We started seeing the appearance in our indoor plants around the summer 2021. By the time we were leaving for our summer camping trip, July-August, it got pretty bad. Dad treated it when we were away, but it's very hard to make it gone. Late summer to early winter, it's hard to grow seedlings from seeds. Pots after pots, almost none grow. When some do, only very little. Imagine a pot has 2x7 or 2x9 holes, each with several seeds. Usually many seedlings come out from each hole, this time could be just 1 or 2 seedlings from the whole pot. Back then we didn't know what's wrong.

                        </li>
                    </ul>                    
                </li>
                <li>Strategies started on late Nov / early Dec 2021:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Changing soil</li>
                        <li>Improving drainage by bottom layer pebbles</li>
                        <li>Covering soil top with pebbles or clay beads</li>
                        <li>Less watering</li>
                    </ul>                    
                </li>
                <li>Nov 2021
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attempt to remove fungus gnats population, especally with renewing soil, reducing the water, and adding sand layer to the surface, was always ongoing. However they just reduced in number and even with a small number of them, a flare up can happen fast.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Dec 2021
                    <ul>
                        <li>It's not until mid Dec the attempt feels to be taking a long  term effect. A new strategy here is covering the soil, especially the one with seeds and seedlings, with cling wrap or paper towel. New soil is used. And following that, even washed seedlings that was previously kept around, was discarded because worry larvae might be actually intact in the roots and can repopulate. With exception of basil and potato that's washed really thoroughly before and after kept in water medium overnight.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Jan 2022
                    <ul>
                        <li>Since then, gnats population decreased tremendously. Seeds grown in such condition, each holes thriving with abundance of seedlings. by January, almost no gnat seen.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A few small outbreaks happen now and then but more or less controlled. Not everyday we see any gnats, and when it does usually just 1 or 2 close to the pot.</li>

                        <li>Vegetable safe insecticide spray<br>
                        We previously owned marigold based insecticide spray and used it late spring, however we haven't been able to locate the bottle, so we got a new one recently. That's why it's very delayed.</li>
