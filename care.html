                        <h6>Watering</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>High, don't let soil dry out</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Arugula</strong>: Regular watering. Water as soon as top inch feels dry. Keep soil consistently moist but not soggy. Fail to do this might cause plant to bolt and flavor ruined.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Basil</strong>: Keep soil regularly moist, 1" of water a week for outdoor, bit more for containers. Water once the top layer of soil dries out,definitely when plant show first sign of wilting (don't let it happen! don't wait for this signal!).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Coleus</strong>: consistenly moist but not soggy.It should not wet all the time, but too long dry will slow plant growth. For indoor, water maybe every 2-3 days, or more if climate rather dry.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Thai chili pepper</strong>: Keep soil moist at all times, never allow soil to become bone dry as it will cause the blossom to drop. Especially during hot dry days. Containers might even need to be watered as frequent as twice a day if it dries out quickly.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Polka dot plant</strong>: Moderate amount of moisture in soil at all time. Water when top hald inch dried out. Don't let soil completely dried out. It can lead foliage to wilt and struggling to survive. Don't get it soggy either, it can cause root rot and kill the plant.  </li>
                                    <li><strong>Potato</strong>: Rely on steady water supply. Water at least 1 inch a week. Sensitive to drought especially when flowers (which is the peak time to form tubers)</li>
                                    <li><strong>Turmeric</strong>: tolerate wet soil, keep moist, don't let soil dry out.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Moderate</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Low to moderate</strong>
                                <ul>

                                    <li><strong>Scarlet Flax</strong>: low to moderate. Overwatering can cause root rot. Very hardly and drought tolerante. But it also says, keep soil moist, water occasionally.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Low</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Bunny tails</strong>: Very forgiving, drought resistant. Water deeply and let it dry out before the next watering. Doesn't like wet feet and root might rot if constantly wet.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Thyme</strong>: drought resistant, prefer under-watered than over-watered. Wait soil to be completely dry before watering. Flower is not a sign of bolting or over-watering. It will continue to thrive as long as keep trimming to promote new growth.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                    <li><strong>Arugula</strong>: Full sun. But if temperature is high, provide shading to avoid wilting and bolting.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Potato</strong>: Actually can handle part shade, but a lot of sunlight is needed to feed the tubers.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Scarlet Flax</strong>: Grow very well in full sun, but will grow even in partial shade.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Coleus</strong>: Part shade. For indoor containers, indirect sunlight in warm months, expose to filtered unlight during the winter. It does need some light even though just a little. If the plants get leggy and pinching doesn't help, it might need more sun.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li><strong>Polka dot plant</strong>: Sign of too much sun is curling leaves and fading leaf color.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Potato</strong>: Every 2 weeks with diluted liquid fertilizer or fish emulsion.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Turmeric</strong>:  Needs a lot of nutrient. Feed every month. All purpose liquid fertilizer works best.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Coleus</strong>: If soil is rich, no need to feed coleus at all. For poor soil, fertilize every month half strength. Color is better when not overly fertilized. Having said that... Container ones might benefit from slow-released fertilizer when starting the pot. Thereafter, feed with diluted liquid fertilizer every 1-2 weeks. Container plants generally need more frequent feeding than garden plants because frequent watering washes the nutrients away.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Scarlet Flax</strong>: Avoid fertilizer, as it can reduce blooming.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Thyme</strong>: Prefers soil that lacks nutrient. Only give diluted fertilizer when it needs a boost. Maybe in the beginning.</li>

                                    <li>Don't overdo nitrogen, it can deter fruit growth. Should be rich in phosporus, potassium, and calcium.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Coleus</strong>: pinch out the growing tips when plants are about 6" tall. If leaves preferred, pinch of flowers under the flower buds, so energy doesn't get drained by flowering and seeding process. Unpruned plants tends to get leggy and might need more sun.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Polka dot plant</strong>: Cut or pinch back top 2 leaves on each stem weekly, to avoid long, lanky, leggy branches. To extend growing season of the plant, clip flowers as soon as appearing, Because the plant will die off/enter dormancy once it finishes flowering.</li>

                                            <li>4-7 weeks after seeding. Wait until it reaches 3" long. Harvest when the leaves are young. Old leaves are tough and bitter.</li>
                                            <li>Partial harvest: cut just the outer leaves, leaving the crown intact.</li>
                                            <li>Full harvest:cut entire leaves just above the ground. If weather is mild, it might regrow.</li>
                                            <li>Flower harvest: If plant bolts, harvest to eat the flowers but not the leaves, because leaves are turning bitter by now.</li>
                                            <li>Use as soon as possible after harvest. Keep in refrigerator up to a week.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Thyme</strong>: Harvest anytime once established. No extra pruning needed when harvested regularly. But it can be cut back if it gets too long/lanky, or to shape. After 3-4 years, potted thyme can be woody. Check out the reference directly for this.</li>

                                            <li>Harvesting young immature potatoes is possible without harm to the plant when the plant reached 1 foot in height, about 50 days after planting. When the plants flower, the are generally ready for harvesting. Gently feel around in the soil and lift out.</li>
                                            <li>For full harvest, wait until the plants reach full size and die out. About 2-4 months, up to 120 days. Potatoes can be left in  ground at this point for several weeks as long as the ground is not wet.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Potato</strong>: Loamy, acidic (5-6). Prone to scab at higher pH. Do not like rich soil. Loose and well-draining. Mulch.</li>
