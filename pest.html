                    <dd>Red, green, yellow, or white tiny spiders (not insects), sucking on plant juice with needle-sharp mouthparts. Length is less than 1 mm.</dd>
                    <dd>Mites form colonies and multiply quickly. Adult females lay about 100 eggs, hatching just 3 days after being laid. Whole life cycle is only 2 weeks.Uncontrolled, it will destroy a plant and move to a nearby plant. Not harmful to human, pets, and farm animal at all though.</dd>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Ideal growing condition: 21-27 &deg;C and dry air. Heated up home in the winter time is ideal for them.</li>
                            <li>Eating by sucking plant juice.</li>
                            <li>Loves to live underneath leaves. So they are found on leafy plants, trees, and prefer ones with greater nitrogen, carbohydrates, and phosphorous.</li>
                            <li>They crawl to bottom side of leaves, puncture individual plant cells, suck out the sap that weeps from the holes.</li>
                            <li>They accept anything comes from the holes, including chrolophyll. Which is why the plants begin turning yellow in spots.</li>
                            <li>Left alone,they'll go after every plant cell they can, sucking from thousands of hole, turning entire leaves and plant yellow over time.</li>
                            <li>Under optimal growing condition, warm (27 &deg;C) and dry, they reproduce very fast and quickly becoming resistant to pesticide.</li>

                            <li>Dusty environment. That's why they are not in soil or carpet (also no food there)</li>
                            <li>They don't last in carpet. The can be inactive, but only for a short period of time. If eggs fall to surface without food, it dies pretty soon.</li>

                            <li>Increase humidity: mist tepid water to the air around the plant.</li>
                            <li>Keep leaves clean: wipe off dust with damp cloth. For fine-leafed plants, use a fine spray bottle with room-temperature water.</li>
                            <li>Keep tools clean: clean gardening tools to reduce spread.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Remove: isolate invested plant, prune badly infested/damaged leaves.</li>
                            <li>Clean:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Clean invested plants with a sponge dipped in soapy water. Use mild dishwashing liquid without fragrance/additives (2 tsp in 1 gallon room-temperature water).</li>
                                    <li>Wash leaves especially underneath. Rinse well.</li>
                                    <li>Wash along the stems too. For ivy for example: make a sinkful of soapy room-temperature water. Swisth the stem through it for several minutes. Rinse thoroughly with clear room-temperature water.</li>
                                    <li>Repeat in 2-3 days if necessary.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Heavy investation: Use insecticidal soap for indoor plants. Spray every 2-3 days to break life cycle. Make sure it's safe for the plant.</li>
                            <li>Neem oil</li>
                            <li>Under optimal growing condition, warm (27 &deg;C) and dry, they reproduce very fast and quickly becoming resistant to pesticide. Rotate pesticide being used.</li>
                            <li>If plant is entirely engulfed by the weebing and turning yellow mostly, dispose it. Don't rescue it. So it doesn't spread.</li>

                    <dd>17 May 2022: Re. Spider mites. Washed leaves of suspected  invested plants. Basil, kemangi, mini rose, bunnytails, pole beans, cucumber, tomatoes, and pumpkin. Removed a lot of yellowing leaves. Cilantro thrown away since it's just more practical to restart.</dd>
