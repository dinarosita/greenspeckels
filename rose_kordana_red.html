                        <p>A miniature rose</p>

                        <h6>A little story:</h6>
                        <p>Purchased early summer 2021, a pot with 4 mini rose plants, with a lot of flowers/buds. For awhile, flowering overlap with the large yellow berolina roses. They were both very beautiful, especially together.</p>
                        <p>After the flowers were spent and deadheaded, it didn't flower again until very lonf time. When it did, the flowers didn't look too healthy. Dark red with many blackened edges.</p>
                        <p>Then it has spider mites investation. Tried to remove by pruning, rinsing, changing soil, but spider mites always come again. The plants looked not very healthy. Leaves crips up and dried and falling. Did vigorous pruning late autumn, and it came back very nice. But not too long. Spider mites back. I don't know it's related or not, the leaves started to crisp up again and drying. Finally late December they are sacrificed along with many other suspected fungus gnat investation. Ginger plants, the only other one with spider mites incestation, has been sacrificed much earlier.</p>
                        <p>There is another Kordana rose purchased. I think pink, closer to the fall season. It was not doing so well. Mixed with this one and at the end sacrificed together.</p>
