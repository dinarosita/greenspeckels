                        <p>Flowering plant of ginger family with yellow-orange rhizomes used for cooking. Native to India and South East Asia. Indonesian: kunyit.</p>

                        <h4>Little history:</h4>
                        <p>Planted from grocery store's rhyzome early December 2021 I think. It was purchased a few months ago and just finally had growing eyes. It took a long time for the eyes to grow. it was back in summer I think, I had tried to plant some rhizomes. Sort of eye-less. It didn't grow for a very long time and the pot was cleaned up in attempt to control fungus gnat investation.</p>
                        <p>Since planted recently with the eye buds, it's been growing quite fast. 6 cutes were planted in 15 cm round pot. On Dec 18, they were moved to 10x30 cm&#13217 container, and only 3 cuts were retained, to give more space. In each, eye buds had grown as well as roots, and 1 of them even poking through the soil already.</p>
                        <p>28 Dec: 2 and 4 cm height shoots (left), 8 cm height with a large (2-3 cm long) leaf (centre), and 6 cm shoot (right).</p>
