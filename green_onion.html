                        <p>Native to Asia. Also called scallion, spring onion, and bunching onion. This species is the one commonly found in grocery stores. This species is considered to be bulbless. The other species, <em>Allium cepa</em>, can form bulb. However can be harvested young too and have similar appearance to this one. At that stage, they function the same in the kitchen.</p>

                        <h6>The story:</h6>
                        <p>Green onion, planted from bottom 5cm of grocery store bought bunch, is fun to have. They grow very fast. even within hours, a little growth can be noticed. By the next day, defenitely can't be missed. Not too practical maybe for cooking since I like to eat large quantity of this at a time, especially the strong tasting one is the bottom white part. But for occasion soup topping, since it needs to be trimmed a lot, it's fun. Also fun to see something growing at home. </p>
                        <p>In the spring 2021, we also planted green onion from seeds. I didn't grow to healthy. The diameter was less than 0.5 cm, dry and limpy. It was sacrificed, sometime in the fall I think.</p>
                        <p>We have been growing grocery store green onion continously since spring 2021, even though time to time the batch is renewed when it didn't look too healthy or fungus gnats investation suspected.</p>
