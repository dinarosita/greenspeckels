                        <p>We Started seeing the appearance in our indoor plants around the summer 2021. By the time we were leaving for our summer camping trip, July-August, it got pretty bad. Dad treated it when we were away, but it's very hard to make it gone. Late summer to early winter, it's hard to grow seedlings from seeds. Pots after pots, almost none grow. When some do, only very little. Imagine a pot has 2x7 or 2x9 holes,each with several seeds. Usually many seedlings come out from each hole, this time could be just 1 or 2 seedlings from the whole pot. Back then we didn't know what's wrong.</p>
                        <p>Attempt to remove fungus gnats population, especally with renewing soil, reducing the water, and adding sand layer to the surface, was always ongoing. However they just reduced in number and even wth a small number of them, a flare up can happen fast.</p>
                        <p>It's not until mid Dec the attempt feels to be taking affect. A new strategy here is covering the soil, especially the one with seeds and seedlings, with cling wrap or paper towel. New soil is used. And following that, even washed seedlings that was previously kept around, was discarded because worry larvae might be actually intact in the roots and can repopulate. With exception of basil and potato that's washed really thoroughly before and after kept in water medium overnight.</p>
                        <p>Since then, gnats population decreased tremendously. Seeds grown in such condition, each holes thriving with abundance of seedlings. by January, almost no gnat seen.</p>
